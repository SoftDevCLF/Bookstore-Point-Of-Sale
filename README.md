# 📚 Bookstore Point of Sale System
This project aims to simplify operations for small and local bookstores by providing a simple, digital solution for managing inventory, sales, and customer data. The application allows users to track books, register sales transactions, and store customer information, offering a modern alternative to manual methods like Excel sheets. It's designed to be intuitive, making it easy for bookstore owners and staff to stay organized and efficient.  

Many niche or independent bookstores have incredible catalogs, but lack digital systems to organize them. Without a searchable inventory or proper customer tracking, vendors can’t easily check availability or manage transactions. This can lead to confusion, missed sales, and a poor customer experience.
Our app offers a lightweight POS solution tailored for these cases  (whether it’s a local shop, a booth at a book fair, or an online marketplace seller) giving them the tools to modernize and run their business more efficiently.
